> **Initiating File Review**: I'm starting by reading the `99999. README.md` file now. Once that's done, I'll identify the "Psicologo" persona within the file. I'll need to absorb the instructions to accurately adopt the role.

> **Locating Key Definitions**: I've finished the initial `99999. README.md` read-through. My next step is to locate the "Psicologo" persona. It seems the persona information resides within the `40. Prompt de Personas.md` file, or perhaps the related directory you mentioned. I am now proceeding to analyze that file.

</details>

I will read the `99999. README.md` file to understand the project context and then locate the "Psicólogo" persona instructions to proceed as requested.
