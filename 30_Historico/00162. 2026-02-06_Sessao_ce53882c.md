> **Assessing Installation Failures**: I've just been reviewing the user's interaction. They're trying to update PowerShell via winget and facing version conflicts. Initial assessment: Winget install executed, but the system isn't reflecting the update. The core issue likely stems from environment variables or PowerShell paths. I need to understand why the newly installed version isn't taking precedence.

> **Verifying PowerShell Install**: After establishing that the user installed PowerShell 7, the key is now to verify that `pwsh.exe` is accessible within the current session's environment. I'll execute a path check to locate the new executable and determine if it's correctly placed and available to the user. This will directly indicate whether the installation completed successfully from a system perspective.

> **Investigating Command Availability**: I'm now focusing on verifying the `pwsh` command's accessibility. My plan is to execute a command to determine if the system recognizes `pwsh`. If found, I'll then move to explain to the user the need to switch to the new executable. The crucial step now is to confirm `pwsh`'s presence within the shell environment to confirm a successful install.

> **Examining PowerShell Paths**: I'm currently investigating the `pwsh` command's absence after a `winget` installation. It seems the PATH variable might need a refresh. I'm noting the standard PowerShell 7 installation directory to streamline future troubleshooting, specifically at `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh`. I will now consider how to automatically refresh it.

> **Verifying pwsh Location**: Okay, I've confirmed that the `pwsh.exe` file does indeed reside at the expected location, `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe`. Now I'm considering why the command isn't immediately recognized post-installation. It seems the issue is solely a matter of PATH refresh, so I need to explore strategies to force an update.

> **Understanding PowerShell Differences**: I've confirmed the installation's success, a crucial first step. Now I'm focusing on clarifying the distinction between PowerShell 7 (Core) and the older Windows PowerShell 5.1, particularly the implications for the user. I'm currently highlighting the importance of recognizing the distinct executable paths, like `pwsh.exe` versus `powershell.exe`, to avoid confusion.

> **Articulating User Instructions**: I'm now prioritizing the user's practical steps. I'm focusing on concisely detailing the key differences: Core is a separate application, and it won't be immediately available in the current terminal. The user's actions: restart the terminal, or locate PowerShell 7 by its Start menu listing or direct file path. Clarity is key, and I'll keep it simple!

</details>

O PowerShell 7 (`pwsh.exe`) é instalado **lado a lado** com o Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell.exe`), ele não o substitui. Como você já terminou a instalação, o executável está no seu sistema, mas sua sessão atual ainda é a versão antiga.

Para usar a versão nova:

1.  **Feche e abra seu terminal:** O `winget` atualizou o PATH, mas o terminal atual não carregou as mudanças.
2.  **Procure por "PowerShell 7"** no Menu Iniciar.
3.  **Digite `pwsh`** em um novo terminal (em vez de `powershell`).

Eu verifiquei e o arquivo já existe no seu computador em:
`C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe`
