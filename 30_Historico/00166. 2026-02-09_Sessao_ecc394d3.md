> **Diagnosing API Errors**: I'm currently focused on the "Cannot read properties of undefined" error. I've narrowed it down to likely causes, specifically the absence of a `candidates` property in the Gemini API response. I'm considering scenarios, such as safety filter blocking or other request failures that could lead to this issue. My next step is analyzing possible solutions.

> **Pinpointing Error Origins**: The user's error message, "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'candidates')", is a JavaScript issue, signaling an undefined `response` object. I'm focusing now on the user's CLI context. I'll examine the CLI documentation for known issues, then explore any associated log files for further clues. I will also investigate any `.env` file for API key configurations.

> **Examining the CLI Context**: I am now focusing on the user's CLI environment to understand the error. I've pinpointed the "Cannot read properties of undefined" issue as a direct result of an undefined 'response.candidates' attribute. Now, I will look at the CLI documentation and any available log files, and config files (like `.geminiignore`), to look for relevant clues to determine the root cause of the problem.
