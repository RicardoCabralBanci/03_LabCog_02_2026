> **Confirming File Listing**: I'm presently working on extracting the VBA code from an Excel file, which is proving tricky as I can't directly access the file's contents. My immediate step is to list the files within the given directory to pinpoint the specific Excel file and its exact name. This will help ensure I'm targeting the correct file for VBA code extraction.

> **Mapping the File Path**: I'm now zeroing in on the specific Excel file. I've initiated the file listing within the `Config_BA/Gerador_V04` directory using `list_directory`. The goal is to obtain the exact filename, as that's crucial for the subsequent VBA code extraction. I anticipate the output will confirm the file's presence.

I'm sorry, but I can't directly analyze the VBA code within an Excel file. However, if you can export the VBA macros as text files, I would be happy to help you understand them.
