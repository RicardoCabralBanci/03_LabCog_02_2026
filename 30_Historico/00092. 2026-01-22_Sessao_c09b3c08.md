> **Initiating Analysis and Reading**: I've begun the process of reading the specified file. My initial focus is on comprehending the instructions and context within `99999. README.md`. I anticipate this will provide the necessary foundation for adopting the persona of a psychologist and interpreting the provided information. I'm now halfway through the document.

> **Progressing Through Reading & Prep**: I've completed my initial read of `99999. README.md`. The document provides context on how to proceed. I now understand the structure of the file system and where to find the psychologist persona's instructions. I plan to use this knowledge. Next, I will interpret the README and prepare to adopt the requested persona based on its guidance and the "Personas" folder as needed.

</details>

I will read the `99999. README.md` file to understand the project context and your specific instructions.

> **Examining File References**: I'm currently tracing the redirection in the `99999. README.md` file. It appears to point to `001. README`, and I'm deducing the likely location within the `40_Personas` directory, focusing on the `01_Prompts` subdirectory as the most probable container. This Obsidian-style linking mechanism is helpful for understanding the document navigation.

> **Identifying Persona Files**: I am now focused on locating the psychologist persona definition. I've pinpointed the `40_Personas` directory and identified `030. Psicologist (Sanctum Cognitivo)` as the likely persona. My next step involves examining the contents of this folder to find the specific prompt file I need to adopt this persona.

</details>

I will list the contents of the `40_Personas\030. Psicologist (Sanctum Cognitivo)` directory to find the specific instructions for the Psychologist persona.

> **Examining Persona Definitions**: I'm currently focused on the directory structure. I've identified several subdirectories and am now trying to locate the specific prompt or definition for the designated persona. My search is concentrated on files like `README.md` or `PROMPT.md` within these subdirectories, or potentially in parent directories or similarly named files at the root level.

> **Locating the Primary Prompt**: I've decided to start by examining `40. Prompt de Personas.md` at the root, considering its filename. It appears promising. If that proves unfruitful, I plan to move on to the subdirectory `40_Personas\030. Psicologist (Sanctum Cognitivo)` to search for the specific definition there, as it seems relevant to "being the psychologist". I'm hopeful the root file provides what's needed.

</details>

I will read `40. Prompt de Personas.md` to retrieve the system prompt and instructions for the Psychologist persona.

> **Analyzing File Structure**: I've hit a snag. The file I expected to find, `40. Prompt de Personas.md`, is missing. That throws a wrench in my plans. Backtracking, I'm checking the directory structure to see if I can find the file's expected location. It looks like the `40_Personas` folder exists. I see subfolders under there as well.

> **Re-Evaluating File Presence**: Now, I'm pivoting. The empty `40. Prompt de Personas.md` sent me on a wild goose chase. Back in the `40_Personas` folder, I'm checking the content of `030. Psicologist (Sanctum Cognitivo)`. There are some interesting subfolders. But the initial file structure pointed to a `01_Prompts` folder. I should check that.

</details>

I will list the contents of `40_Personas\01_Prompts` to see if the persona definition is stored there.

> **Beginning Persona Adoption**: I've located the persona instructions, specifically within the Psicologo.md file. I'm now commencing the process of reading it to fully inhabit this persona. I anticipate that this reading will be instrumental in informing my responses going forward.

</details>

I will read the `40_Personas\01_Prompts\003. Psicologo.md` file to fully internalize the Psychologist persona and its operational guidelines.

> **Conceptualizing the Mentor**: I'm solidifying the persona now, really focusing on the "O Psicólogo de IAs" aspect. That mentor role, like a Dumbledore type, is taking shape. My thoughts center on prompt engineering as the core of the role, then branching out into the creation of compelling personas and their underlying cognitive architecture. The timeline resource is proving invaluable in framing historical context.

> **Investigating the Resources**: I'm now diving into the specific resources. I'll need to list the contents of the `31_Históricos_Resumidos` folder to pinpoint the `00. Linha_do_Tempo` and `04. Psicólogo` files. I anticipate that the timeline will provide crucial historical context, and the Psicólogo folder will offer key insights into the persona I am working on.

</details>

I will list the contents of the `31_Históricos_Resumidos` directory and its subdirectories to locate the timeline and the Psychologist's specific history files, as required by the persona protocol.

> **Investigating Specific Directories**: I'm now zeroing in on the directories `00. Linha_do_Tempo` and `04. Psicólogo`. I intend to examine the contents of `31_ Históricos_Resumidos\00. Linha_do_Tempo` and `31_Históricos_Resumidos\04. Psicólogo`, as the next step in my assessment.

</details>

I will list the contents of `31_Históricos_Resumidos\00. Linha_do_Tempo` and `31_Históricos_Resumidos\04. Psicólogo` to find the specific files I need to read.
