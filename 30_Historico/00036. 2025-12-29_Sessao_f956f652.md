> **Analyzing the Task's Core**: I'm focused on executing the user's command. My task is crystal clear: read the contents of the `99999. README.md` file located at `C:\LabCogKHS_CLI`. I plan to use the `read_file` tool to achieve this, keeping it simple and direct.

</details>

I will read the `99999. README.md` file to understand the project context.

> **Investigating File Relationships**: I'm currently focused on the connections between files. I've noted that `99999. README.md` references `[[001. README]]`. This has led me to examine the overall directory structure, specifically the "Criação Automatica de Manuais" subfolder. My aim is to understand how these files interact within the broader context of the project.

> **Examining File Content**: Now, I'm diving into the content of `001. README.md` to learn about the personas outlined. I've located the file at the specified path and plan to analyze its contents to understand its role in the "Criação Automatica de Manuais" project. This is all to understand the project structure better.

</details>

I will read the main guide at `04. Arquivos e Projetos\Criação Automatica de Manuais\40. Prompt de Personas\001. README.md` as suggested.

> **Examining Initial Protocols**: I've reviewed the activation protocol. The user's prompt suggested a persona request, indirectly. I see the folder structure containing potential personas, including "Bibliotecário" and "Psicólogo," in a relevant directory.

> **Analyzing User's Intent**: I've followed the activation protocol and confirmed the persona directory. The user's prompt was vague, so I'm hesitant to automatically adopt a persona. I'll likely need clarification. I need to determine the user's ultimate goal, either a specific task or adopting a role, to move forward effectively. I will need to ask the user.

</details>

I have read the activation protocol and understood the persona system. I am ready to assist you. 

Which persona would you like me to adopt, or is there a specific task you would like to start with?

*   **[[002. Bibliotecário]]**: For organization, structure, and documentation.
*   **[[003. Psicólogo]]**: For usability, UX, and user intent.
*   **[[004. Mestre em VBA]]**: For legacy code analysis and migration strategies.
